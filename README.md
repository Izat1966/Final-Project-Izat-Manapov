Project's purpose is to create a code which can manage plans, event and coordinate their details , i decide to make a simple code as complicated ones are very hard for me , in code i used class structures and functions , 2 functions one to allow user cin struct details called addEvent, and another one to display all details of input called displayEvent, to use sofware you just have run a code in any compiler then in will input you strcut details , then you have to just cin your event name, time, location, date and some xtra info(optional).And also i make a presentaion which link i leave below.
